Hello, my name is Strypper and I am a .NET developer with over seven years of experience in building cross-platform applications using C#, XAML and .NET MAUI. I am passionate about creating modern, responsive and native UIs for Windows, Android, iOS, macOS and Samsung Tizen devices using the latest technologies and best practices of the .NET framework.

I have worked on various projects ranging from productivity apps, social media apps, educational apps and more. I have used WinUI 3, Blazor Desktop, Xamarin.Forms, SkiaSharp and other .NET MAUI libraries to develop these applications. I have also used Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions and Hot Reload as my development tools.

I love learning new things and keeping up with the evolving .NET ecosystem. I am always eager to explore new features such as .NET 6,.NET MAUI Community Toolkit,.NET Hot Restart,.NET Multi-targeting Packs and more. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with other developers through blogs, podcasts and online communities.

I am looking for a challenging and rewarding opportunity where I can apply my skills and passion as a .NET developer. I believe that I can bring value to your team by delivering high-quality software solutions that meet your business needs and exceed your expectations.
<br/>
P/S: also a designer
